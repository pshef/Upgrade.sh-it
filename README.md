# Upgrade.sh-it
A very simple upgrade script I wrote for my computer since I got tired of the app shop not upgrading everything and leaving me with an anoying notification. I currently have both apt and flatpak on my system, and this will upgrade them both, and yes I know there's redundancies.

To run, make upgrade.sh script executable and then run it. It should prompt for root password and then proceed as needed.
